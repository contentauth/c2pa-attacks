## Installation

_What can we say about OS support?  Mac only?_

## Testing locally in the Git directory

Unclear what this means "If you just want to do local testing builds..."

Doesn't this tool do local testing of assets, etc?  Does this mean local build/testing of the tool itself? 

This seems somewhat out of place where it is. Can we find a better location?

## Testing Certificate Authority fields

This repo is private: <https://github.com/c2pa-org/testing-private/tree/main/cert-generation>.  Either don't mention it or change its visibility.


_Should we move `attacks/README.md` into `docs` for consistency?_
